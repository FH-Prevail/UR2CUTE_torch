# UR2CUTE

**Using Repetitively 2 CNNs for Unsteady Timeseries Estimation**

UR2CUTE is a specialized forecasting model designed for intermittent time series data. By employing a dual CNN approach with PyTorch, it effectively addresses the challenges of predicting both the occurrence and magnitude of demand in irregular time series patterns.

## 📋 Overview

Intermittent demand forecasting presents unique challenges due to irregular and unpredictable demand patterns, characterized by periods of zero demand followed by random non-zero demand. Traditional forecasting methods often perform poorly on such data.

UR2CUTE employs a two-step approach:
1. A CNN-based classification model predicts demand occurrence (zero vs. non-zero)
2. A CNN-based regression model estimates the magnitude of demand

This dual-phase approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy for intermittent demand, particularly in predicting periods of zero demand.

## 🔍 Features

- **PyTorch Implementation**: Uses PyTorch's efficient tensor operations and GPU acceleration
- **Two-Step Prediction Process**: Separate models for order occurrence and quantity prediction
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: CNNs effectively capture temporal patterns in intermittent data
- **Lag Feature Generation**: Automatically creates lagged features to capture historical dependencies
- **Custom Loss Functions**: Optimized loss functions for each prediction task
- **Sklearn Compatibility**: Follows scikit-learn API conventions for easy integration
- **Direct Multi-Step Forecasting**: Predicts multiple future time steps in one pass
- **Automatic Device Selection**: Utilizes GPU acceleration when available

## 📝 Methods

### fit(df, target_col)

Fits the UR2CUTE model on the time series data.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (pandas.DataFrame): Time series data with at least the target column. Must be sorted by time.
- `target_col` (str): The name of the column to forecast.

**Returns:**
- The fitted UR2CUTE model instance.

### predict(df)

Predicts the next `forecast_horizon` steps from the input DataFrame.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (pandas.DataFrame): Time series data with the same columns as used in fit(). Must be sorted by time.

**Returns:**
- numpy.ndarray: The predictions for each step in the horizon.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Aggregates demand data (e.g., daily to weekly)
   - Generates lag features to capture historical patterns

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Classification Model**: CNN architecture with convolutional layers, max pooling, and dropout
   - **Regression Model**: Similar CNN architecture optimized for quantity prediction

3. **Training Process**:
   - Models are trained using PyTorch's DataLoader for efficient batch processing
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss
   - Uses Adam optimizer with customizable learning rates

4. **Prediction Process**:
   - Classification model predicts if demand will occur (probability > threshold)
   - Regression model predicts the magnitude of demand
   - Final prediction combines both models' outputs

## 🏆 Performance

UR2CUTE outperforms traditional forecasting techniques including:
- Croston's method
